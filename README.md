# journal

The purpose of this project is to create a web application that allows users to keep a journal. The purpose of this project is primarily for me to learn to write web apps using flask and to familiarize myself with flask modules like SQLAlchemy, loginmanager, and some sort of encryption. I also intend to attempt to pass this as a major project for CSH.
