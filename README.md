# journal

The purpose of this project is to create a web application that allows users to keep a journal. The purpose of this project is primarily for me to learn to write web apps using flask and to familiarize myself with flask modules like SQLAlchemy, loginmanager, and some sort of encryption. I also intend to attempt to pass this as a major project for CSH. 

Current TO:DO:
Style:
* Add CSS to flashed messages on every page
* Rework the style of the homepage to match the rest of the site and retain responsive design principles, rewrite the remote css

Minor functionality:
* Finish implementing CSS grid for the homepage header


Major functionality:
* Fix the order in which time / date show up in the entry display
* Make it so that each user can only access their own entries
* Add encryption
* Add HTTPS
